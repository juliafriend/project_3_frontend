Frontend:

Tech: Built with React, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, AtlasDB

Approach and concept: 
    Miguel is from LA and Julia is from Boston so we decided to create an app with recommendations for our respective cities. Miguel built the backend with a model for Boston recommendations and an unrelated model for LA recommendations. Julia built the front end with full CRUD on the Boston model. We decided not to do full CRUD on LA for the sake of time and repetition (you are able to post and delete from LA). 

    Miguel built the ternary to put both models behind respective buttons. 

Styling: 
    We used flexboxes and vanilla CSS for styling. 

Challenges:
    We attempted to incorporate google maps with iframes but were unable to. We did not attempt with JS.
